# LIBFT

Libft is the foundation for all projects in the 42 curriculum. FT stands for the Forty-Two library. This is a recreation of all of the most fundamental functions from C's standard libraries. It also includes multiple data structure implementations. This library can be [compiled modularly](#MODULAR-COMPILATION)!

According to the rules of the libft project, the only allowed functions are malloc(), free(), and write(). Any other functions you might want to use must be recreated yourself.

## GETTING STARTED

To set up this project, run `git clone https://github.com/mint42/libft` in the folder of your choosing. Then run the `make` command in the root of the repository. The Makefile will build the libft.a file which can be linked to a test main or project. All of the necessary public include files are symlinked at compile time to the `includes` folder (or whatever folder is defined by `SYM_INCLUDES_DIR` in [config.mk](https://github.com/mint42/libft/blob/master/config.mk)) at the root of the repository for ease of linking.

### MODULAR COMPILATION

By default, libft will compile all modules into a single `.a` file. To request that only certain modules be compiled, before running the `make` command, set up a file named `libft_mods.mk` in your repository's parent directory. This file should contain a variable named `MODS` which is a list of the requested modules. The libft's Makefile will handle its own dependencies, so no need to include any module that a project does not explicitly need. If you're unfamiliar with Makefile format, feel free to use this template and comment out what you don't need:

```
